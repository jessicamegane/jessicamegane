# Hello, I'm Jessica Mégane 👋

👩‍🎓 I am a recent master in Intelligent Systems.

📖 My main research interest at the moment is Evolutionary Computation.

📝 During my master's I developed Probabilistic Grammatical Evolution, a variant of the Grammatical Evolution, which is published [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08389) and with code available [here](https://github.com/jessicamegane/pge).

💭 I plan to apply to the PhD program at the University of Coimbra.
