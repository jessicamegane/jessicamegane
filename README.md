# Hello there, I'm Jessica MÃ©gane ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at the University of Coimbra, where I am a researcher at the [Evolutionary and Complex Systems](https://twitter.com/ecoscisuc) group at [CISUC](https://www.cisuc.uc.pt/en) being my main research interest Evolutionary Computation. My main research interest is in developing probabilistic variants of Grammatical Evolution, which involves exploring the use of probability distributions to improve the performance of this popular evolutionary algorithm.

I'm also the author of several papers on this topic, which you can find in my GitHub profile along with the source code. Here are some of my publications:

- ðŸ“„ Jessica MÃ©gane, Nuno LourenÃ§o, Penousal Machado, [Probabilistic Grammatical Evolution](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-72812-0_13) (EuroGP 2021) - In this paper, we introduce a new probabilistic variant of Grammatical Evolution and demonstrate its effectiveness on several benchmark problems. You can find the source code for this algorithm in my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/jessicamegane/pge).
  
- ðŸ“„ Jessica MÃ©gane, Nuno LourenÃ§o, Penousal Machado, [Probabilistic Structured Grammatical Evolution](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9870397), IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC 2022) - In this paper, we further refine the approach of Probabilistic Grammatical Evolution by incorporating a structured representation based on Structured Grammatical Evolution, that allows for the evolution of more complex solutions. You can find the source code for this algorithm in my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/jessicamegane/psge).

- ðŸ“„ Jessica MÃ©gane, Nuno LourenÃ§o, Penousal Machado, [Co-evolutionary Probabilistic Structured Grammatical Evolution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3512290.3528833) (GECCO 2022) - In this paper, we extend the previous work on Probabilistic Grammatical Evolution by introducing a co-evolutionary approach that allows for the evolution of the individuals at the same time as a grammar with probabilities. This is currently the **best proposed method in terms of performance**. You can find the source code for this algorithm in my GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/jessicamegane/co-psge).
