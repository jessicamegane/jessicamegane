# Hello, I'm Jessica Mégane 👋

👩‍🎓 I am a PhD student at the University of Coimbra. During my master's I developed Probabilistic Grammatical Evolution, a variant of [Grammatical Evolution](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781402074448), which is published [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08389) and with code available [here](https://github.com/jessicamegane/pge).
