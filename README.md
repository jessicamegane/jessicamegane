# Hello, I'm Jessica MÃ©gane ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at the University of Coimbra, and I am a researcher at the [Evolutionary and Complex Systems](https://twitter.com/ecoscisuc) group at [CISUC](https://www.cisuc.uc.pt/en) being my main research interest Evolutionary Computation.

I developed some probabilistic variants of [Grammatical Evolution](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781402074448), which source code and papers can be found in my profile. These are my current-published papers:
